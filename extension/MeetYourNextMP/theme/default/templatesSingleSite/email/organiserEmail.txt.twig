Dear {{ email }}

MeetYourNextMP is a non-partisan website that lists hustings events. We then make
these listings available to the public and anyone else who wants to use them for
free.

In this way, we help people be better informed about their candidates and encourage
them to get involved in local and national politics.

We are cited by people like Citizens Advice Bureau, MIND for better mental
health, The Campaign Against the Arms Trade, MacMillan Cancer Support, Concern,
Democratic Dashboard and The Power Of The Cross. We have served over 150,000
pageviews to people wanting to meet their candidates at events like yours, with
support from prominent politicians in several different parties.
