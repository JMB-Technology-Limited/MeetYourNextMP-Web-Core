	<p>Dear {{ human.title }}</p>

	<p><a href="https://meetyournextmp.com">MeetYourNextMP</a> is a non-partisan website that lists hustings events.
		We then make these listings available to the public and anyone else who wants to use them for free. </p>

	<p>In this way, we help people be better informed about their candidates and encourage them to get involved
		in local and national politics.</p>

	<p>We are cited by people like Citizens Advice Bureau, MIND for better mental health, The Campaign Against the Arms Trade,
		MacMillan Cancer Support, Concern, Democratic Dashboard and The Power Of The Cross. We have served over 100,000 pageviews to people wanting to
		meet their candidates at hustings events, with support from prominent politicians in several different parties.</p>

	{%  if events|length > 0 %}

		<p>For {{ area.title }}, we know of these hustings:</p>

		{% for event in events %}
			<p>{{ event.getStartAt|tolocaltimeformatted('D jS M', 'Europe/London') }} - <a href="https://meetyournextmp.com/event/{{  event.slugForURL }}">{{  event.summaryDisplay }}</a></p>
		{%  endfor %}

		<p><b>Are you attending any other hustings? Or can you give us any more information on those hustings?</b></p>

	{%  else %}

		<p><b>For {{  area.title }},
			we donâ€™t know of any hustings. Are you attending any hustings?</b></p>

	{%  endif %}

	<p>Anyone <a href="https://meetyournextmp.com/event/new">can make a user account and add hustings to our site using our simple web process</a>.</p>

	<p>(Please note we are looking for independent hustings events only.)</p>

	<p>Please <a href="https://meetyournextmp.com/contact">do get in touch</a> if you have any questions or any feedback - you can simply hit reply.</p>

	<p>Thank you,<br>
		James Baster of MeetYourNextMP.</p>

	<p>(This site is supported by the non-partisan <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/">Democracy Club</a>.)</p>
