Dear {{ human.title }}

MeetYourNextMP is a non-partisan website that lists hustings events. We then make
these listings available to the public and anyone else who wants to use them for
free.

In this way, we help people be better informed about their candidates and
encourage them to get involved in local and national politics.

We are cited by people like Citizens Advice Bureau, MIND for better mental
health, The Campaign Against the Arms Trade, MacMillan Cancer Support, Concern,
Democratic Dashboard and The Power Of The Cross. We have served over 100,000
pageviews to people wanting to meet their candidates at hustings events, with
support from prominent politicians in several different parties.

The hustings for {{  area.title }} are at:
https://meetyournextmp.com/area/{{  area.slugForURL }}

Are you attending any hustings? Or can you give us any more information on these
hustings?

Anyone can make a user account and add hustings to our site using our simple web
process.
https://meetyournextmp.com/event/new

(Please note we are looking for independent hustings events only.)

Please do get in touch if you have any questions or any feedback on the site -
you can simply hit reply.

Thank you,
James Baster of MeetYourNextMP.

(This site is supported by the non-partisan Democracy Club.)
