			<h3>Welcome</h3>

			<p>We want to help everyone meet their candidates and make an informed choice at the UK general election. We list events and hustings that:</p>

			<h3>What events do you list?</h3>

			<ol class="normal">
				<li>Are open to the general public, regardless of membership or lack of membership of a particular group and</li>
				<li>Have representatives of more that one political party speaking or are run by an independent body.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Where is the data from?</h3>

			<p>We crowd source the data by asking people like you to add events they know of. We make all the data available as Open Data for reuse by anyone who wants to publicse such events.</p>

			{% if currentUser is null %}
				<p>Please <a href="{{ config.getWebIndexDomainSecure() }}/you/register">create an account</a> to add events using our easy web process.</p>
			{%  endif %}

			<h3>Please use our data!</h3>

			<p>All our event data is Open Data. (Attribution would be nice!)</p>

			<p>There are no limitations, unless your use starts to cause problems for our servers.
